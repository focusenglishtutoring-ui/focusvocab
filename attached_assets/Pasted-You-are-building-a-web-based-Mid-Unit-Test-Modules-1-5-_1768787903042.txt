You are building a web-based “Mid-Unit Test (Modules 1–5)” page in my English vocabulary app. This test appears immediately after Module 5.

==================================================
CORE GOAL
==================================================
Create a Mid-Unit Test that behaves exactly like my existing End-of-Module quizzes:

- Students answer ALL questions first
- NO correct answers are shown while working
- Correct answers + score are revealed ONLY after clicking “Finish Test”
- Students can retry the test

This is a MEANING-recognition test, not spelling or grammar.

==================================================
INPUT METHOD (LOCKED)
==================================================
- Students answer using DROPDOWNS (select inputs), NOT typing.
- Dropdown options come ONLY from the Word Bank (exact strings).
- No tense changes, no inflections, no spelling variation.

==================================================
WORD BANK DISPLAY
==================================================
- Display the Word Bank at the TOP of the page.
- Put it inside a rectangular box with:
  - border
  - padding
  - rounded corners
  - light background
- Maintain the EXACT order below (do NOT reorder or alphabetize).

WORD BANK VISUAL STATE:
- UNUSED word → normal text
- USED word → STRIKETHROUGH text (like a student crossing it out with a pencil)
- Strikethrough updates LIVE when answers change.

==================================================
DROPDOWN BEHAVIOR
==================================================
- Each question has a dropdown containing ALL Word Bank items.
- When a word is selected for one question:
  - That word becomes DISABLED in all other dropdowns
  - That word shows STRIKETHROUGH in the Word Bank
- The selected word remains selectable for its own question (so students can change answers).

CHANGING ANSWERS:
- Students may change answers freely before finishing.
- When an answer is changed:
  - The old word loses strikethrough and becomes available again
  - The new word gains strikethrough and is disabled elsewhere

OPTIONAL (RECOMMENDED):
- Add a small “Clear (×)” button next to each question to remove the selection.

==================================================
FINISH / REVEAL BEHAVIOR
==================================================
- “Finish Test” button:
  - Disabled until ALL questions have an answer
- On click:
  - Lock all dropdowns
  - Reveal score (e.g., “Score: 42 / 50”)
  - Reveal correct answer per question
  - Mark each question with ✅ or ❌
- Show “Retry” button:
  - Clears all answers
  - Removes all strikethroughs
  - Restores full word availability

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
==================================================
- Reuse existing quiz logic/components if possible.
- Otherwise create: MidUnitTest.jsx (or .tsx).
- Keep styling consistent with the app.
- Mobile-friendly (Word Bank wraps into columns).
- Local state only (no backend).
- Absolutely NO answer leakage before Finish.
