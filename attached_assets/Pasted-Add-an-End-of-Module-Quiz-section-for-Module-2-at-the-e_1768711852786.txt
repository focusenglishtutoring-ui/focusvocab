Add an “End of Module Quiz” section for Module 2 at the end of the module flow, implemented the same way as Module 1’s end-of-module quiz (same UI/UX patterns, same grading flow, same review + retry behavior).

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Quiz content is fixed (no AI generation). Use the exact questions/options/answers below.
2) Student view:
   - Do NOT show target words (only show question text and A/B/C options).
   - Allow selecting exactly one option per question.
   - “Submit Quiz” button enabled only when all questions are answered.
3) Results view after submit:
   - Show score: “You got X/10”
   - Show per-question feedback:
     - The question text
     - Student selected choice (A/B/C)
     - Correct choice (A/B/C)
     - Mark each as Correct/Incorrect
   - Provide “Retry Quiz” button to reset answers.
4) Scoring:
   - Score is simply number correct / 10.
5) Data model:
   - Store the quiz as a local constant (array of objects).
   - Each object includes: id, prompt, choices {A,B,C}, correct ("A"|"B"|"C")
6) UX:
   - Match Module 1 quiz styling and behavior.
   - Include progress indicator if Module 1 uses it (e.g., “Question i of 10”).
7) Persistence (optional, match Module 1):
   - Save best score in localStorage as module2QuizBestScore and display it on results screen (only if Module 1 does best-score).

QUIZ DATA (MODULE 2):
Use this exact quiz content and correct answers.

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "prompt": "She cares a lot about her ______.",
    "choices": {"A":"appearance","B":"appear","C":"apology"},

    "choices": {
      "A":"I aim to finish early today.",
      "B":"My aim is to finish early today.",
      "C":"The aim was very difficult."
    },
    "correct": "A"
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "prompt": "He didn’t want to ______ with his brother again.",
    "choices": {"A":"argument","B":"argue","C":"apply"},
    "correct": "B"
  },
  {
    "id": 8,

  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "prompt": "Choose the sentence that uses apply correctly (meaning: ask for a job/course).",
    "choices": {
      "A":"She applies make-up before work.",
      "B":"He applied for the course last week.",
      "C":"The nurse applied pressure to the wound."
    },
    "correct": "B"
  }
]

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Add a new route/screen “/module/2/quiz” (or your project’s equivalent naming).
- Place a “Start End-of-Module Quiz” button at the end of Module 2 content that navigates to it.
- Reuse the same quiz component used for Module 1 if possible (pass quizData + storage key as props).
  Example: <ModuleQuiz moduleId="2" quizData={MODULE_2_QUIZ} bestScoreKey="module2QuizBestScore" />
- Do not refactor unrelated code.

DELIVERABLE:
Return ONLY the minimal code diffs/changed files required to:
1) add the Module 2 end-of-module quiz screen/component,
2) connect the end of Module 2 flow to the quiz,
3) implement submit → score + per-question review + retry,
4) (optional) best score localStorage matching Module 1 behavior.
