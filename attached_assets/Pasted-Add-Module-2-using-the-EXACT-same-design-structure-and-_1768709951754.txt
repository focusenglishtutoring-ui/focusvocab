Add Module 2 using the EXACT same design structure and UX flow as Module 1. Do NOT redesign anything.

FLOW PER WORD (same as Module 1):
1) Display: word + part of speech + Traditional Chinese
2) Display: “What does it mean?” + meaning sentence(s)
3) Display: “Examples:” + 3 examples where the target vocabulary word is bolded
   - For verbs: add bracketed tense labels ONLY when the verb form changes (e.g., appears = present simple -s; appeared = past simple; aimed = past simple).
   - Do NOT add tense labels for nouns/adjectives or when the verb form is unchanged.
4) Display: “Check your understanding:” + a 3-option multiple choice (A/B/C). Do NOT show the correct answer in the UI.
5) Next button goes to the next word entry.

After the last Module 2 word, show a placeholder message:
“End-of-module quiz coming soon.”
