You are building a web-based vocabulary learning MVP in Replit.

TASK:
Add an “End of Module Quiz” section for Module 1 at the end of the module flow. This quiz has 10 multiple-choice questions, shows one question at a time (preferred) or all at once (acceptable), and provides instant grading after submission.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Quiz content is fixed (no AI generation). Use the exact questions/options below.
2) Student view:
   - Do NOT show target words (only show question text and A/B/C options).
   - Allow selecting exactly one option per question.
   - “Submit Quiz” button enabled only when all questions are answered.
3) Results view after submit:
   - Show score: “You got X/10”
   - Show per-question feedback:
     - The question text
     - Student selected choice (A/B/C)
     - Correct choice (A/B/C)
     - Mark each as Correct/Incorrect
   - Provide “Retry Quiz” button to reset answers.
4) Scoring:
   - Score is simply number correct / 10.
5) Data model:
   - Store the quiz as a local constant (array of objects).
   - Each object includes: id, prompt, choices {A,B,C}, correct ("A"|"B"|"C")
6) UX:
   - Keep UI clean and mobile-friendly.
   - Provide progress indicator: “Question i of 10” if showing one at a time.
7) Persistence (nice-to-have):
   - Save best score in localStorage as module1QuizBestScore, display it on results screen.

QUIZ DATA (MODULE 1):
Use this exact quiz content and correct answers.

]

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- If you already have routing/screens for modules, add a new screen/route “/module/1/quiz” and place a “Start End-of-Module Quiz” button at the end of Module 1 content that navigates to it.
- If using React, implement as a component <ModuleQuiz moduleId="1" quizData={...} />.
- If using vanilla JS, implement in a dedicated section div and render dynamically.

DELIVERABLE:
Return the updated code (or file diffs) showing:
- New quiz screen/component
- Wiring from the end of Module 1 → quiz
- Clean UI and working grading + retry
- Optional best-score localStorage support
