CORE REQUIREMENTS
1) The Final Test has 7 sections (Reading 1–7). Users must score >= 90% on the current section to unlock the next section. Sections beyond the current unlocked one are visible but disabled/greyed-out.
2) Each section has its own word bank (exactly as provided). The word bank is shown in a rectangular bordered box above the passage.
3) Answers are selected via dropdowns embedded in the passage blanks. Users can change answers any time.
4) Used-word visual logic:
   - When a user selects a word in any blank, that word becomes “used” and is displayed with STRIKETHROUGH in the word bank.
   - Also, in ALL dropdown option lists for that section, used words should appear with strikethrough (or visually muted + strikethrough) to suggest they’re already used.
   - However, do NOT prevent selecting used words (students may need to change answers).
   - If a word is no longer selected in any blank, remove the strikethrough (unused again).
5) Check button behavior:
   - Each section has a “Check Answers” button that is DISABLED until all blanks in that section have a selected answer (no empty selections).
   - When clicked, it reveals which blanks are correct vs incorrect.
   - IMPORTANT: It should NOT show the correct answers for wrong blanks. It only marks them as incorrect (e.g., red outline).
   - User can edit answers after feedback and click “Check Answers” again as many times as needed.
6) Scoring:
   - Score is percentage = (correct blanks / total blanks) * 100, rounded to nearest whole number.
   - Display “Score: XX% (Y/Z correct)”.
   - If score >= 90%: show a success message and unlock the next section.
   - If score < 90%: show a message like “Need 90% to unlock next section. Try again.”
7) Persistence:
   - Save progress (unlocked section index + best score per section) in localStorage so refresh doesn’t reset.
   - Provide a “Reset Final Test” button to clear localStorage and restart.
8) accessable after end of second-half unit test and in unit overview section in "Tests and Assessements"
9) design with same style and struture as mid-unit and second-half unit tests

IMPORTANT DETAIL ABOUT WORD STRINGS
The dropdown options MUST match the word bank strings EXACTLY, including:
- spaces
- slashes
- parentheses
- punctuation
Example: "air conditioning / air conditioner (n.)" must match exactly.
